    description: 'These crispy baked buffalo chicken wings are perfectly crispy, without any traditional frying, Paleo friendly, and naturally gluten free. Just a few simple ingredients are all you need to whip up a batch! In a large bowl combine chicken, 2 tbsp hot sauce, vinegar, oregano, paprika, garlic powder, chili powder salt and pepper. Mix well and let marinate for 30 minutes. Place wings on a broiler rack and broil on low, about 8 inches from the flame for about 10-12 minutes on each side. (All ovens are different so be careful not to burn and make sure it is cooked before removing) While chicken cooks, heat the remaining hot sauce until warm. Toss the hot sauce with the chicken and arrange on a platter. Serve with celery and carrot strips and blue cheese dressing or dipping.',

    author: 'Ivon Ivanova',
    description: 'This delicious skillet pizza is far from light-tasting, but nutritionally it soars above most other options in the deep-dish pizza category. I cook it in a cast-iron skillet to help give it a deep-dish pizza look and feel. For a crisp, not soggy crust, the key is to start the crust on the stove top, then top it, and transfer it to the oven. Round out your meal with a leafy side salad! First, preheat the oven to 450ºF. Sprinkle cornmeal evenly in bottom of a 10-inch cast-iron skillet. Stretch pizza dough to an 11-inch circle. Fit dough into bottom and up sides of skillet. Place skillet over medium-high heat on stovetop; cook until bottom of crust is dry and beginning to brown (pull crust slightly away from side of skillet to peek at it), about 8 minutes. Remove from heat; prick bottom of crust several times using a fork. Then, spread marinara sauce over crust in skillet; sprinkle with cheese and pepperoni. Brush crust edges with oil. Transfer to preheated oven; bake until crust is golden and cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Let cool 5 minutes; slice. If desired, garnish with crushed red pepper.',

    title: 'Air-Fryer Sweet Potato Chips',
    author: 'Brooka Yaqoob',
    description: 'Start with two medium size sweet potatoes and try to look for ones that are not too long. This way you can use the full length of the sweet potatoes as the length of the fry. Remember that these air fryer sweet potato fries will shrink after cooking, so look for a shape slightly longer than the ideal fry length. Next, peel the sweet potatoes, and cut off the skinny ends. You can save those for a different recipe. Then cut the sweet potatoes in half lengthwise. This will make it easier to lay them flat on the a cutting board and start cutting into long slices. The thinner you cut them, the more crispy they will be. I recommend that you cut them 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thickness. Now that you have the sweet potatoes sliced, youre ready to cook them in the air fryer. Most air fryers require preheating for best results. While the air fryer is preheating, you can select the seasoning for the air fryer sweet potato fries. I like to keep it simple. I toss it with just a teaspoon of olive oil, along with garlic powder, paprika, salt and pepper. Use your hands to make sure each fry is coated well with the seasoning. Then place the sweet potatoes into the air fryer basket, making sure not to overcrowd them. At the halfway cooking point, shake the basket to make sure they are cooking evenly, and then continue cooking. Each air fryer is different, so you may want to watch the first batch to make sure that the cooking temperature and time yield the results youre looking for.',

    title: 'Cauliflower Pizza Crust',
    author: 'Stephen Robinson',
    description: 'Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Remove the leaves from the cauliflower and trim the stalk end, then cut into chunks. Blitz half the cauliflower in a food processor until finely chopped, like rice. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the remaining half. Tip all the cauliflower in a bowl, cover with cling film and microwave on High for 5-6 mins until softened. Tip onto a clean tea towel and leave to cool a little. Once cool enough to handle, scrunch up the tea towel and squeeze as much liquid as you can out of the cauliflower, then transfer to a clean bowl. Stir in the ground almonds, egg, oregano and plenty of seasoning. Line a baking tray with baking parchment and grease with oil. Mound the cauliflower mix into the centre of the tray, then use a spoon and your hands to spread out into a 30cm round. Make it a little thicker at the edges to create a crust. Bake for 15-18 mins until golden brown and starting to crisp a little at the edges. Meanwhile, heat a griddle pan, brush each aubergine slice on both sides with a little of the oil, season and cook for 5-6 mins, turning once, until softened and charred  youll need to do this in batches. Transfer to a plate. Brush the onions with oil, season and griddle for 5-8 mins until softened and charred. To make the tomato sauce, whizz the canned tomatoes, tomato purée, garlic and some seasoning in a blender until smooth. Transfer to a small saucepan, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 8-10 mins until thick (you dont want any watery tomato soaking into the cauliflower base). Tear half the basil leaves and stir through the sauce. Once the cauliflower base is cooked, set aside to cool a little. Turn the oven up to 240C/220C fan/gas 8. Drain the mozzarella and pat dry with kitchen paper. Spread the tomato sauce over the base, sprinkle over the Grana Padano, then arrange the aubergines, red onion and mozzarella on top. Scatter over the chilli flakes and return to the oven for 10-12 mins. Before serving, shave over a little more cheese and scatter with the remaining basil leaves.',
